Probatio
========

A set of benchmark tests against different hashing algorithms, using Python implementations.
 These include:
1. md2
+ md5
+ sha1
+ sha224
+ sha256
+ sha512
+ keccak
+ bcrypt

Timing Method
-------------

Timing will all be done using clock() in Python, starting the 'clock' at the beginning and stopping at the end. I'll be hashing the standard dictionary on a Unix system which is 285886 words.

### Generic specifications of the testing computer
* 2.5GHz
* 8GB of RAM
